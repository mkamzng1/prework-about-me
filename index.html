      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a programmer looking to leave a positive mark on the world, one line of code at a time.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Santa Clara, CA and I was raised in San Jose. I moved around a bit before settling back down in the bay area after getting my degree in southern California. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love playing games (console games, PC games, Tabletop RPGs, etc.) When I'm not playing games, I like to read and do some writing of my own. My favorite genres are fantasy and Sci-Fi.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I've always wanted to be a writer, but I also want to be able to pay the bills and provide for my family.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently, I live in San Jose, CA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a developer at a company where I can feel like my work is making a difference. If I had my choice, I'd be at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or Nvidia.</p>
